# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Football âš½ðŸ¤–

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Football has been a huge part of my life â€” both as a player on the field and as a passionate fan watching the sport for years.  
My fascination with the beautiful game extends beyond playing; Iâ€™ve always been curious about the strategies, decision-making, and coordination that make great teams truly exceptional.

This project brings that passion into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, where I explore how **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** can teach AI agents to play football in a simulated environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
Right now, Iâ€™m working on **3v3 football simulations** where multiple agents learn to:
- Pass and dribble under pressure
- Maintain optimal positioning
- Defend strategically
- Score goals through coordinated play

The agents are trained using reinforcement learning techniques to develop **emergent team strategies** without explicit hardcoding.  
This stage focuses on controlled, smaller matches to refine the algorithms and ensure agents learn fundamental cooperation.

## ðŸ“Š Visuals & Analysis
ðŸ“· **Planned Inclusions:**
- Heatmaps of player movement
- Graphs showing reward progression
- Screenshots from simulated matches
- Comparative statistics for different training strategies

## ðŸ”® Future Directions
The next step is to scale beyond 3v3 into more complex team formats with richer tactical depth.  
A key research direction will involve the use of **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model communication and decision-making between agents, allowing for:
- Better passing and positioning decisions
- Adaptive strategies against dynamic opponents
- More human-like, creative plays

These advancements aim to push the boundaries of how AI understands and plays football, with the potential to inform not only gaming but also robotics, strategy modeling, and sports analytics.
